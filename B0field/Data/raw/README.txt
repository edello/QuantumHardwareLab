Notes About Phyphox data:
- while calibration can be turned off (which seems to have an even bigger influence on the absolute values) it is questionable how accurate absolute values for even uncalibrated data even are
- It should be noted that introducing a complex object (permativity wise, magnetizable) like a phone to a magnetic field WILL Change the properties of such field. While it will be hard to estimate this influence, as even simulations will become so complex as it wont be possible to make an estimate such short time. So, in interest of time, just consider that the magnetic field measured, even in Terms of fluctuations, are going to be quite different from the actual magnetic field.

earth_room_[..]
- datasets acquired in the main hallway, Center floor, 4th Floor, GuMi, at the same Position rotated so that B_x~0. 3 datatsets for 3 different devices. Pre calibration of device by Rotation. Phones airplane mode. 10s meausurement, 1x50Hz and 2x100Hz 

Long_room_[...]
- same Setup as earth_room. But longer measurement and only 1 device. Verification test for allan Variation. Measuring time 5 & 10min at 50Hz

earth_[...]_2
-same Setup, just Repetition of measurement on a different day. 1 device left due to illness of that Person.
