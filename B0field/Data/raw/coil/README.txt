#GOAL#
The Goal of this measurement was to examine how magnetic field fluctuations differ if we measure an artifical MF. After deciding that measuring at a Setup for a Diamond NV Center would take too much effort to even Change the Setup in a way that we can even insert a phone, we instead Chose a simple coil (N=40, l~2.3cm) which allows more flexibility for inserting a phone. Again, we wanted to compare two phones to measure the magnetic field via phyphox.

#SETUP#
We arbitrarily chose one of the two coils. Then we, placed it on a plastic box so it is elevated from the metallic table, which might cause additional interference with the magnetic field. Two power Sources were possible to use. A multimeter was connected in series to measure the current. While one of the power Sources was able to display the current directly, we decided that a multimeter is usually more trustworthy (from experience, this was not verified in any way), and a better way to find out whether current is flowing or not. The phone was then placed in the middle so we can measure the magnetic field via the z-axis of the phone. As the Location of the phones sensor is unknown, the phone, and unlikely to be in the center as rotation significantly changes the magnitude of B, it should be noted that we are probably not measuring the magnetic field in the center of the coil. This makes comparisons with a formula for the magnetic field in a coil only meaningful in terms of scale.

#APPROACH#
- Finding out which of the four connectors work by measuring the current with a multimeter. In the same way, also to determine which wires to connect to, to drive current through one coil. Multimeter more reliable than direct magnetic field measurements in phone as even an unplugged coil interacts with the sensors leading to different results than away from the coil.
- After current was established, we tried measuring the magnetic field with phyphox leading to
1) smaller PS: Strong fluctuations in the magnetic field that seemed to follow a systematic pattern (i.e. irregular jumps from 0T to ~-1mT) or a sinusoidal enveloping of the fluctiations. Whether or not calibration mode was turned on or positioining of the phone made no difference. See data 
2) bigger PS: Even though the same systematic behaviour wasnt visible here, strong fluctuations also made this measurement difficult. Especially as there were immense differences in the values between both devices (same as 1)). As previous Experiments lead us to believ that measurements between devices are, at least, similar this means that either:
- Measuring magnetic fields of higher Magnitude or more significant fluctuations is unsuitable using phyphox.
- The fluctuations in the current (likely hence to the power source due to the differences between those two, although connector issues might also be a possibility) cause different interactions between both devices, leading to vastly different results.

Either way, further examination of the data seems unnecessary to us. Comparing data sets where the differences are this obvious is not leading to anything meaningful. Also, with these Kinds of fluctuations, a ramsey simulation seems ill advised. To us it will be more interesting to examine decoherence times under more realistic conditions that are as stable as possible using certain setups.
