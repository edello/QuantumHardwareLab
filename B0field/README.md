# Magnetic Field Measurements



In this part of our project we wanted to examine how we can generally measure magnetic field fluctuations and what might be important to consider for these kinds of measurements. 

First we decided on a phone with the software phyphox due to availability as our sensor of choice. The measurements mainly consisted of measuring the earth manetic field with different devices as comparison. Later, an attempt was made to also measure an artificial magnetic field of a coil. The idea is that the two main (or most obvious) problems of a phone, which are

* The size of the phone and uncertainty of the sensors location (this will NOT be further examined as temporal changes will be the focus)
* Electrical components of the phone (which exact shape and permeativity might be hard to determine) interact with any magnetic field

could be further examined. However, we ran into some issues which are explained in more detail in .../data/raw/coil/README.txt.

Ultimately we aimed to determine the sensitivity and noise characteristics of different devices, mainly using the allan variance and PSD.
